# propelauth_environment_level_auth_configuration (Resource)

Environment-level Auth Configuration. This is for configuring elements of the signup and login experience in PropelAuth that you may want to differ between test and production environments.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "propelauth_environment_level_auth_configuration" "test_example" {
  environment                = "Test"
  require_email_confirmation = false
  allow_public_signups       = true
}

resource "propelauth_custom_domain_verification" "my_custom_domain_verification" {
  # Fields are incomplete here for simplicity.
  # See the documentation for the "propelauth_custom_domain_verification" resource for more information
  environment = "Prod"
}

# Prod and Staging environments don't exist until a domain has been verified for them,
# so we need to depend on the verification of the domain before creating the environment-level auth configuration
resource "propelauth_environment_level_auth_configuration" "prod_example" {
  depends_on = [
    propelauth_custom_domain_verification.my_custom_domain_verification
  ]
  environment                = "Prod"
  require_email_confirmation = true
  allow_public_signups       = false
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `environment` (String) The environment for which you are configuring the login and signup experience. Accepted values are `Test`, `Staging`, and `Prod`.

### Optional

- `allow_public_signups` (Boolean) If true, new users will be able to sign up for your product directly in the PropelAuth hosted pages.The default setting is true for all environments.
- `require_email_confirmation` (Boolean) If true, all users are required to have confirmed email addresses. Whenever PropelAuth doesn't know for certain whether a user's email address is in fact owned by them, PropelAuth will trigger an email confirmation flow. The default setting is true for `Prod` and `Staging` environments but is false for `Test` for ease of development.
- `waitlist_users_require_email_confirmation` (Boolean) If true, all waitlisted users are required to have confirmed email addresses. Whenever PropelAuth doesn't know for certain whether a waitlisted user's email address is in fact owned by them, PropelAuth will trigger an email confirmation flow. The default setting is false for all environments.
