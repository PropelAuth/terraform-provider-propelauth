# propelauth_api_key_alert (Resource)

API Key Alerting. This sets up alerting for end users emailing them when their API key is about to expire. Note: API key alerts are only available on some pricing plans. These alerts are only sent for users in production environments and can only be set up if you have a production environment.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a PropelAuth API key alert.
resource "propelauth_api_key_alert" "example" {
  # Cannot setup api key alerting for end users without a production environment.
  depends_on          = [propelauth_custom_domain_verification.my_prod_domain_verification]
  advance_notice_days = 30
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `advance_notice_days` (Number) The number of days before an API key expires by which time end users will receive an email alert.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# As there is only one api_key_alert per project there's no need to specify the id,
# but terraform import requires an id to be specified, so we can use an arbitrary string here.
terraform import propelauth_api_key_alert.example arbitrary_string_here
```
