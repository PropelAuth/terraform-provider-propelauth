# propelauth_fe_integration (Resource)

Front-end Integration. This is for configuring the front-end integration for one of your project's environments.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure how the front-end of your application integrates with PropelAuth.
resource "propelauth_fe_integration" "example" {
  environment          = "Test"
  application_url      = "http://localhost:3001"
  login_redirect_path  = "/home"
  logout_redirect_path = "/goodbye"
  additional_fe_locations = [
    {
      domain              = "http://localhost:3002"
      allow_any_subdomain = false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `application_url` (String) The URL of the application that will be integrated with PropelAuth. This is url is used in combination with the `login_redirect_path` and `logout_redirect_path` to redirect users to your application after logging in or out. `application_url` must be a valid URL and can only be set for `Test` environments. For `Staging` and `Prod` environments, the `application_url` must be the verified domain for the environment or a subdomain of it. See  `propelauth_custom_domain_verification` resource for more information. Do not include any trailing path separator (`/`) in your URL. For example, `https://any.subdomain.example.com` where `example.com` has been verified.
- `environment` (String) The environment for which you are configuring the front-end integration. Accepted values are `Test`, `Staging`, and `Prod`.
- `login_redirect_path` (String) The URL path to redirect users to after they log in. This path is appended to the `application_url` to form the full URL. For example, if `application_url` is `https://example.com` and `login_redirect_path` is `/dashboard`, the full URL will be `https://example.com/dashboard`.
- `logout_redirect_path` (String) The URL path to redirect users to after they log out. This path is appended to the `application_url` to form the full URL. For example, if `application_url` is `https://example.com` and `logout_redirect_path` is `/goodbye`, the full URL will be `https://example.com/goodbye`.

### Optional

- `additional_fe_locations` (Attributes List) Additional front-end locations that are allowed to integrate with PropelAuth. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--additional_fe_locations))

<a id="nestedatt--additional_fe_locations"></a>
### Nested Schema for `additional_fe_locations`

Required:

- `domain` (String) A domain that will also be allowed to access user information. The domain must include a scheme. For example, `https://example.com`.

Optional:

- `allow_any_subdomain` (Boolean) If true, any subdomain of the domain to integrate with PropelAuth is also allowed to access user info. The default value is false.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Import using the target environment as the ID: `Test`, `Staging`, or `Prod`.
terraform import propelauth_fe_integration.prod_example Prod
```
